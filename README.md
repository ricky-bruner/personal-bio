## My first coding project at NSS

The purpose of this project was to show what I learned during the Jumpstart Program at NSS. Throughout the 3 weeks the course ran, we covered Beginner HTML, CSS, and basic vanilla Javascript. The backend of the course covered jQuery, used in this project, and Bootstrap, which I chose to omit in lieu of strengthening my own CSS understanding. 

## Goals for the future

Now that I've developed more understanding of the various aspects of front end development, I'd like to come back to this soon to make it more modular, follow proper coding "ethics" with CSS to reduce the massive amount of redundency found in the code, and I've like to hardcode very little in the HTML. My current ambitious goal is to remove the current directory of pages and have everything load on the same page via jQuery. The nav bar would simply hide everything until clicked, and the only display the anchor that was selected.

## This is merely a humble beginning :) (please be kind)
